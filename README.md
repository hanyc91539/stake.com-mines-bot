## What is the Martingale Strategy?
 Definition and Background The Martingale betting system is a popular gambling strategy that involves doubling your bet after each loss to eventually recoup all losses with a single win. Originating in 18th-century France, this system has been widely used in various gambling games.

## How the Martingale Strategy Works
### Step-by-Step Explanation
 -Initial Bet: Start with an initial bet, for example, $1.
 -Doubling the Bet: Double the bet after each loss until you win.
 -Recovering Losses: The goal is to recover all previous losses plus a profit equal to the initial stake.
### Example Scenario:
 -Bet $1 and lose (total loss: $1).
 -Bet $2 and lose (total loss: $3).
 -Bet $4 and win (total gain: $4, net profit: $1).

## Applying the Martingale Strategy in Mines
### Initial Setup
 -Starting Bet: Begin with a base bet of 10 cents.
 -Board Setup: Choose a board setup with three mines and five diamonds to achieve a 2X multiplier.

### Gameplay Demonstration 
 To illustrate the Martingale strategy, letâ€™s go through a sequence of wins and losses:

 -First Bet: Start with a bet of 10 cents. If you win, you reset to the initial bet size.
 -Subsequent Bets: If you lose, double the bet to 20 cents, then 40 cents, and so on until you win. After a win, reset to the initial bet size.

### Resetting the Bet
 Resetting to the initial bet size after a win is crucial in the Martingale strategy. This allows you to start fresh and manage your bankroll effectively.


## Key Steps in the Martingale Strategy
 1. Base Bet: Start with a small initial bet.
 2. Doubling the Bet: Increase the bet size after each loss.
 3. Resetting the Bet: Return to the base bet after a win.
 4. Continuous Cycle: Repeat the process to recover losses and make a profit.
